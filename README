Idea and stuffs:

database storing connection snapshots, consisting of:
UnixTimestamp RouterMAC(ID) ClientMAC

possible requests to database:

>routers(from,to) -> unique router MACs
>clients(from,to) -> unique client MACs

>router_clients(from, to) -> macs of unique connected clients to router in that time span

for a router graph time/clients just do multiple router_clients(from,to) requests for different spans
and visualize the length of the client array

client_connections(from, to) -> return an array of connections in form of {routerMAC, fromStamp, toStamp}
this works by assuming that if a client is missing in a snapshot or changed routers, the connection was lost

for a timeline of the client:
use client_connections(from,to)
visualize ;)

for a timeline of router where you see when which client connected:
use router_clients for a span
for each client use client_connections for that span and filter for connections to that router
visualize
